# Medium Blog clone

You can view the live site [HERE](https://medium-clone-sanity-ten.vercel.app/)

This is a personal project to learn new technologies and get up to date with best practices

## Technologies

- Typescript
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Sanity
- GROQ

Basically all the blog posts are fetches from a Sanity API, which has a studio in which multiple editors cand add new content. For the post pages I use Incremental Static Regeneration with a 60 seconds interval. Also the Post page supports adding and viewing comments.
